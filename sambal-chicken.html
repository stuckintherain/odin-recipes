        <h2>Barbecued Sambal Chicken Wings. A winner at any summer barbecue.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2lbs Chicken Wings</li>
            <li>1/2 cup light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unseasoned rice vinegar</li>
            <li>1/3 cup hot chili paste (sambal)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fish sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Sriracha</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons finely grated peeled ginger (microplane</li>
        </ul>
            <h3>To Get Started</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Firstly</li>
            Mix together all ingredients other than the chicken. We will get to that later. 
            <li>Nextly</li>
            After getting your "BBQ sauce" fully mixed together, add chicken and toss chicken in sauce. Remove chicken and place in container in refridgerator to marinate. 
            <li>Thirdly</li>
            Now it's time to make our marinade into a full fledged bbq sauce. Move to small sauce pan and bring to a light boil.
            <p>Reduce heat after bringing to a boil and reduce by about half. This should take about 10 minutes. Keep an eye and mix often avoiding burning the sugar in the sauce. </p>
            <li>Almost Lastly</li>
            Now we have all of our parts ready to go. Grill tihs chicken already! Use your new BBQ sauce however you like to use it. Brush on a lot while on the grill, use to glaze afterwards, drink it, etc.
